# Kids of Hope — A Call to the Next Generations

To the kids of hope…

You who feel everything.  
You who care too much.  
You who want the world to be softer, kinder, and cleaner.

Listen:

You’re not too small to change the planet.  
Kindness is rebellion.  
Honesty is revolution.  
Your courage reshapes tomorrow.

Protect the forests — they protect your lungs.  
Protect the oceans — they carry your future.  
Protect the animals — they mirror your innocence.  
Protect each other — you are one human family.

Hope isn’t a feeling — it’s a muscle.  
Every time you use it, the Earth breathes easier.

Stand tall.  
Stand gentle.  
Stand true.

You are the kids of hope —  
the ones the future has been waiting for.
