## 1. People’s Summary

We, the children of this planet — the kids of Mother Nature — were born into a world that cared for us before we ever cared for it.  
We breathed air we did not clean, drank water we did not protect, ate from soils we did not preserve, and lived in a climate we did not stabilize.

But now the world shows signs of stress.  
The air is heavy, the oceans tired, the forests thin, the climate unstable, and many lives feel the pressure.

We want something better:

- A world where breathing clean air is normal.  
- A world where water does not poison us.  
- A world where food keeps us alive instead of making us sick.  
- A world where our children are not punished for mistakes they did not make.

This Constitution is our promise to protect life, protect the planet, and protect the future.

It says that every human being deserves clean air, clean water, safe food, and a peaceful mind. These are not luxuries. They are the basic conditions of being alive.

It says that families must be safe, that children must grow in healthy surroundings, that mothers and caregivers must be protected, and that elders must not be abandoned to heat, pollution, or neglect.

It says that communities deserve green spaces, clean streets, and an environment that reduces stress and conflict instead of increasing them.

It says that nations become stronger when they protect their lands, waters, and people — and weaker when they destroy them. Patriotism means protecting the place you call home.

It says that humanity shares one air, one ocean, and one climate. No border can stop smoke, storms, drought, or rising seas. We rise together or fall together.

It says that nature has the right to exist. Forests, rivers, oceans, animals, and ecosystems are not decorations; they are the machinery of life. Destroying them is destroying ourselves.

It says that future generations have a right to a livable world. We did not choose the planet we inherited, but the next generation will live with the consequences of our choices. We are not owners of this world; we are caretakers.

This Constitution is an invitation and a responsibility:  
to care for ourselves,  
to care for each other,  
to care for every living being,  
and to care for the world that raised us.

We are the kids of Mother Nature —  
and we choose to grow into guardians of the planet we call home.
